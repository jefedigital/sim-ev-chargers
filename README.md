 # sim-ev-chargers

sim-ev-chargers is a Python application that simulates electric vehicle charging stations to analyze charging patterns and infrastructure requirements. 

## Introduction

This project integrates Large Language Models to enhance the simulation of EV charging usage and provide data-driven insights. By leveraging LLMs, sim-ev-chargers can generate realistic charging demand profiles and station occupancy rates to help optimize charging infrastructure deployment.  

The tool aids in simulation configuration, result analysis, and documentation generation to streamline the overall workflow. The integration with LLMs enables more accurate modelling without extensive manual tuning.

## Key Features

- Configuration-driven simulation engine 
- LLM-assisted simulation parameter tuning
- Automatic report generation with key findings
- Graphical representation of charging demand and infrastructure utilization 
- Scalable and customizable for multiple use cases
